## Context
Model forms part of a multi-level analysis.  We use the county level for this analysis, over time as well.  In addition, we'll do path modelling to make our projections for the relationship structure explicit, and hopefully, some spatially explicit local-scale modelling.

## Response variables
Suggest separate analyses for the following responses:

* Birds (within and among functional groups, as discussed)
* Pollinators (bees)
* Water quality (maybe, if we can get it)


```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
  library(xtable)
  data_eg <- data.frame(species = c("birdspecies_a", "birdspecies_b", "birdspecies_c", "birdspecies_d"), habitat = c("farm", "farm", "forest", "forest"), food = c("insect", "grain", "fruit", "insect"), disturbance = c("intolerant", "tolerant", "intolerant", "tolerant"))
  print(xtable(data_eg),type='html')
```



## Predictors
* Forest cover
* Protected areas (as distinct from forest)
* Intensity - yield/acre by crop/crop group (TBC)
* Area of said crop (TBC)
* some kind of fragmentation index of average farms/crops and forest cover
* Pesticides - will have to be by crop, but could then be aggregated to group.
Another way of trying to nabble out the yield-vs-intensity could be to add a multiplier for fertilised land to the 'intensity' scale (easy enough, I think it's in NASS). Or lumped as pesticides, fungicides and herbicides.  Or look at historical application of since-banned pesticides and their rates and change from 'historic' (pre pesticide) application to 'modern' (so only two time points)
* For a time sequence, change in land cover proportions (forest, crop, etc) since last measure

## Random effects
Some thoughts

```
+ (1|State_population/County_population) #these are all getting at pesky urbanisation effects we may choose to incorporate as fixed effects once we sought the main ones
+ (1|size_urban_area)
+ (state/county|populationsize) #an alternative to the above, random slope
```
