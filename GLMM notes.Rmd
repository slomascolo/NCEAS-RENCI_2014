## Context
This model forms part of a multi-level analysis, looking at the effects of rural production variables on biodiversity over time. Level of replication is county.x`

## Questions
1. In some cases we will have time in as a fixed effect, where we want to predict based on current trends.  In others we will only have it in as a random effect.  Where we have it in as a fixed effect, is there a clear best option between raw pop size; proportion pop size over time; or scaling and centering popsize? 
2. Spatial autocorrelation beyond a (1|State/County) approach.  Abutting county neighbours nested within state? Or full distance matrix based on central lat/lon of county?
3. Any suggestions for accounting for the fact  biodiversity measures are point estimates of a random size (citizen science data) (and annual) whereas the rest of our variables are by county, and predominantly 5 yearly?

## Prediction
We would like to predict whether the response slope is positive or negative (and magnitude) in the following factual scenarios:

1. Broad scale - land use change
    a. Key disperser/pollinator species (univariate) and bird functional group (univariate) and among bird functional groups (multivariate; NMDS and permanova [adonis]) as a response to land use change
    b. Same as above as a response to metrics of land use intensity
2. Finer grained - land management (examples only, using univariate responses above)
    a. Projection: 
        i. pesticide usage risk decreases by c(10, 50, 80)%; land use change continues on current trajectory; and
        ii. pesticide usage risk decreases by c(10, 50, 80)%; cropping yield and area of fertilised land increase; land use change plateaus.
    b. Prediction:
        i. Predicting effect of land use changes on function group diveristy (etc)

### Predictors (details, examples for finer scale analysis)
```
predictor.matrix <- expand.grid(
  pesticide = c("continued_trajectory", "plateau", "decreasing", "increasing"), #numeric 
  cropping_area = numeric; ha/county ha or ha/total non-urban ha,
  forest_cover = numeric, potential fragmentation multiplier,
  average_farmsize * yield = #numeric,
  time = 1997 - 2012 (at minimum))
  
where: 
- pesticide = application/ha * risk * ha * crop (or some measure thereof) (**)
- cropping_area = proportion of county in crops (+/- split into fert/unfert),
and crops are split into functional groups (so yes, 
either multiple separate predictors or a ??multivariate predictor)
- average_farmsize*yield (+/- fert) is aimed at getting a measure of intensity of the cropping
```

### Random effects
We'd like to take account of:

* Repeated measures 
* Differing rates of population growth
* State-level regulation (i.e. nesting within state)
* Urban area (where not accounted for in the fixed effects)
* Spatial autocorrelation
* Soil types (probably, main soil type in state)

Proposing to do this using the following syntax:
```
+ (1|State/County); or (State/County|time_period)  #these are all getting at pesky 
urbanisation effects we may choose to incorporate as fixed effects later
+ (1|size_urban_area); or (size_urban_area/time_period)
+ (1|populationsize) 
+ Abutting neighbour analysis nested within state
+ (1|soil_type)

```

## Response variables 
Suggest separate models for the following responses:

* Birds (within and among functional groups)
  - Grassland
  - Forest
  - Anthropogenic
* Pollinators (bees)
* Water quality

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
  library(xtable)
  data_eg <- data.frame(
    species = c("birdspecies_a", "birdspecies_b", "birdspecies_c", "birdspecies_d"), 
    habitat_functional_group = c("farm", "farm", "forest", "forest"), 
    food = c("insect", "grain", "fruit", "insect"), 
    disturbance = c("intolerant", "tolerant", "intolerant", "tolerant"))
table_eg <- xtable(data_eg, type = 'latex', caption = "Conceptual layout of functional groups bird data")
print.xtable(table_eg, comment = FALSE, caption.placement = "top")
```


### Family for response variables
1. Poisson for count data (presence only obviously)
2. Binomial to look at present bird levels as a proportion of historical levels (later)
