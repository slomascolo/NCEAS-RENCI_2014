In the United States, industrial farming has become widespread in the Midwest and other regions, which has resulted in habitat destruction (State of the Birds 2014) as well as degradation or contamination of critical resources. The rise of the Corn Belt (including Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, and Ohio) as an agricultural region in the Midwest (Medley et al. 1995), increasing industrialized corn production to support expanding ethanol production (Wallander et al. 2011), and extensive grain production for use in livestock feed (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014) have drawn considerable attention to the outcomes for biodiversity.  In particular, there is growing interest in the roles that agricultural pesticides play in decline of species of conservation concern (Hallmann et al 2014; can add US citation).Some calculations suggest that less than 0.1% of pesticides applied to crops reach target pests and the excess moves through throughout agricultural and adjacent ecosystems, contaminating soil, water, and biota (Pimentel & Levitan 1986). Pesticide application rates have increased markedly in recent decades (Pimentel & Levitan 1986): an estimated 3-fold increase in total U.S. application across twenty-one major crops between 1960—1980, before leveling off in the early 21st century (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). Insecticides account for a diminishing amount of the overall total pesticide applications in U.S. agriculture (including herbicides, fungicides, soil fumigants), accounting for 6% in 2008, compared to 58% of total applications in 1960 (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). However, newer insecticides applied at low rates, including synthetic pyrethroids (e.g., permethin, cypermethrin) and neonicotinoids (e.g., imidicloprid, clothianidin, thiamethoxam), have become widely used (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). Neonicotinoid use may be underestimated, as these chemicals are often applied as seed treatments, which are not generally captured by pesticide use surveys (Fernandez-Cornejo et al. 2014). Nearly all conventional corn seed and approximately half of the soybeans in the U.S. are treated with neonicotinoids (Stoksad 2013, Stevens & Jenkins 2014) as are 90% of canola seeds (Sokora et al. 2008, Stevens & Jenkins 2014). Their active pathway and systematic nature have made neonicitiniods a favored agrichemical worldwide (Pollack 2011); imidacloprid is the most widely used insecticide in the world in recent decades (Yamamoto 1999).Despite their widespread role in U.S. industrial agriculture, relationships among neonicitinoid use and outcomes for species of conservation concern are not well understood. Some concerns have been raised about direct effects of neonicotinoids on non-target vertebrate species (Goulson 2013). In general, these pesticides expected to be less harmful to mammals and birds than invertebrates, as neonicotinoids work by by blocking nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (Matsuda et al. 2001) and bind with considerably less affinity to receptors in the central nervous system of vertebrates (Tomizawa & Casida 2005) and more affinity in invertebrates (Matsuda et al. 2001). Pesticides in this class are systemic, present throughout treated plants, as they are distributed through vascular systems?as water moves through plant tissues. Thus, treating plants, or coating ?seeds, with neonicotinoids can render roots, leaves, stems, flowers, nectar, pollen, and guttation fluid—toxic to insects (Stevens & Jenkins 2014). However, recent field and laboratory studies show that neonicotinoid insecticides can have deleterious effects on non-target invertebrate species (can add some cites from Hallmann paper: Gill et al. 2012 bees, Henry et al. 2012 honey bees, Whitehorn et al. 2012 bumblebees, VanDijk et al. 2013 macro-inverts in surface waters; Easton et al. 2013 pollinating flies & beetles, Roessink et al. 2013 mayfly nymphs). Invertebrates comprise a significant part of the diet of insectivorous bird species throughout the year and others during the breeding season (Sibley 2009 “Guide to bird life and behavior”).   Imidacloprid was registered and approved for use in 1994 by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Index of Cleared Science Reviews for Imidacloprid (Pc Code 129099) U.S. EPA.)Years of Agricultural Census: 19921997200220072012http://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/ ### **Research question and study area**   We investigated two hypotheses: 1)  agricultural industrialization is positively correlated with increased use of neonicotinoid pesticides and 2)  three of the most widely used neonicotinoids in U.S. corn and soy-- clothiadidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam-- (Hladik et al. 2014, Table 1) had a negative impact on insectivorous bird populations. For this proof-of-concept paper, we targeted the U.S. State of Ohio, as it illustrates nationwide trends in industrialization of agriculture and has comprehensive data available for pesticide applications (available from the U.S. and Ohio Departments of Agriculture, data 19XX- 201X) and bird populations (Breeding Bird Survey, data 19XX- 201X). Also, Tyson has butterfly data here, so we’re headed for phase 2 with invertebrates. Boom!   Key discussion points: Imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin are applied to seeds at seed treating facilities prior to distribution to growers for planting. The Biological and Economic Analysis Division (BEAD) of the U.S. EPA concluded “that these seed treatments provide negligible overall benefits to soybean production in most situations” (EPA 2014). ReferencesBaker, N.T., and Stone, W.W., 2015, Estimated annual agricultural pesticide use for counties of the conterminous United States, 2008–12: U.S. Geological Survey Data Series 907, 9 p., http://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ds907 Note that for this file these are application rates, which are measured as follows: “Annual county-level pesticide use was estimated for 423 herbicides, insecticides, and fungicides applied to agricultural crops grown in the conterminous United States during 2008–12. For all States except California, pesticide-use data were compiled from proprietary surveys of farm operations located within U.S. Department of Agriculture Crop Reporting Districts (CRDs). Surveyed pesticide-use data were used in conjunction with county annual harvested-crop acres reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture 2007 and 2012 Censuses of Agriculture and the 2008–11 County Agricultural Production Survey to calculate use rates per harvested-crop acre, or an “estimated pesticide use” (EPest) rate, for each crop by year. County-use estimates were then calculated by multiplying EPest rates by harvested-crop acres for each pesticide crop combination…”EPA [Environmental Protection Agency]. 2014.

County-level estimates of total agricultural use for each pesticide were allocated to agricultural land within each county, as defined in the National Land Cover Database 2011 (Jin and others, 2013). National Land Cover Database 2011 (NLCD11) Planted/Cultivated categories 81 (Pasture/Hay) and 82 (Cultivated Crops) were combined to simply differentiate agricultural land from non-agricultural land. The NLCD11 was then generalized to one square kilometer cell size and the percentage of agricultural land for each cell was calculated. The proportion of county agricultural land included in each one square kilometer cell was multiplied by the total county use for each pesticide to calculate the proportional amount of use allocated to each cell. To display pesticide use on the annual maps for each compound, all of the cell values nationwide for the entire period were divided into quartiles and a color-coded map was generated for each year; the quartile classes were converted to pounds per square mile. http://www.epa.gov/caddis/ssr_herb_int.html Herbicide introduction tab from US EPAThis notes that glyphosphate and atrazine are the most commonly used herbicides – note this draws on 2001 data.
